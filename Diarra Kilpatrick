  <p>Diarra Kilpatrick, who stars in the BET+ series “Diarra From Detroit,” created the kind of TV show that you must recommend to everyone you know. The dark comedy is hilarious and captivating, taking you on a wild ride within its first season. With Kilpatrick’s more-than-capable hands on the reins, the series is unlike anything else you’ve seen in recent years.</p></div></a>
